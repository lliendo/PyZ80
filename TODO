Tasks :
-------

    * When zexdoc.com is tested PyZ80 never ends. Moreover the first
    test is never passed. This is a serious bug in one of the jump
    instructions or maybe an instruction is not properly setting
    a flag. A successful execution trace of zexdoc would be a good
    starting point to track down the error.

    * The interruption mechanism is not yet implemented.

    * Some devices need to be developed (CTC, SIO, PIO) to make
    the emulator more functional.

    * Improve documentation.
