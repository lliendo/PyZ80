About  PyZ80 :
--------------

    PyZ80 is a Z80 emulator written in entirely in Python.
    The emulator is not yet finished, an currently is being
    tested.
    As the proyect evolves, documentation will be added, thus
    the main target of this proyect is to learn basic emulation
    topics.

Using PyZ80 :
-------------

    By running python cpu.py -h you should be able to see all
    command line options available. If impatient here's basic
    example :
    
        python cpu.py -p /path/to/1st/binary:0x100,/path/to/2nd/binary:0x200 \
                      -t /tmp/exec_trace.log
                      -s 0xFF

    The example above will perform the following actions :

        1 - Load binary "/path/to/1st/binary" at address 0x100
        2 - Load binary "/path/to/2nd/binary" at address 0x200
        3 - Set the logfile to "/tmp/exec_trace.log"
        4 - The emulator will begin to execute instructions at
            address 0xFF

    The -p option allows you to load more than one binary file.
    Always the -p option expects the following format : PATH:ADDRESS
    where PATH is an absolute or relative path to a binary file
    and ADDRESS is an hexadecimal value between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF.
    When -t is not specified log activity is discarded by writing
    to /dev/null.
    When -s is no specified the emulator will start executing
    instructions from 0x0000.

    In the example above note that if the first binary is more
    than 256 bytes length then the second binary will overwrite
    bytes from the first binary so be careful when loading
    multiple files.

Tests :
-------

    The zexdoc.com and zexall.com under the tests directory 
    were borrowed from the YAZE AG emulator.
