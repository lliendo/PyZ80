About  PyZ80 :
--------------

        PyZ80 is a Z80 emulator written entirely in Python.
    The emulator is not yet finished, an currently is being
    tested.
        As the code evolves, documentation will be added, thus
    the main target of the project is to learn basic emulation
    topics.

Using PyZ80 :
-------------

        By running python pyz80.py -h you should be able to see all
    command line options available. Here's a basic example :
    
        python pyz80.py -p /path/to/1st/binary:0x100,/path/to/2nd/binary:0x200 \
                        -t /tmp/exec_trace.log
                        -s 0xFF

    If you're running on a Windows platform :
    
        python pyz80.py -p c:/path\\to\\1st\\binary:0x100,d:/path\\to\\2nd\\binary:0x200 \
                        -t c:/tmp\\exec_trace.log
                        -s 0xFF

    Any of the examples above will perform the following actions :

        1 - Load binary "/path/to/1st/binary" at address 0x100
        2 - Load binary "/path/to/2nd/binary" at address 0x200
        3 - Set the logfile to "/tmp/exec_trace.log"
        4 - The emulator will begin to execute instructions from
            0xFF

        The -p option allows you to load more than one binary file.
    Always the -p option expects the following format : PATH:ADDRESS
    where PATH is an absolute or relative path to a binary file
    and ADDRESS is an hexadecimal value between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF.
    When -t is not supplied log activity is discarded by writing
    to the null file.
        When -s is not specified the emulator will start emulation
    at 0x0000.
        The -b option adds VERY limited support of BDOS output
    syscalls. This was added in order to test the emulator
    using the zexdoc instruction exerciser.

        In the example above note that if the first binary is more
    than 256 bytes long then the second binary will overwrite
    bytes of the first one, so be careful when loading multiple files.

Tests :
-------

        PyZ80 comes with some tests programs. The purpose of these
    tests is to use its traces to debug and fix the emulator if
    an incorrect behaviour is detected.

        The zexdoc.com and zexall.com under the tests directory 
    were borrowed from the YAZE AG emulator.
